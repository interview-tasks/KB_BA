# Business Metrics Reference Table

| # | Metric | Definition & Formula | Worked Example | Data Required | Common Pitfalls | Recommended Actions |
|---|--------|---------------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Average Order Value (AOV)** | Average revenue per transaction<br>`AOV = Total Revenue / Number of Orders` | $120,000 ÷ 2,400 = $50.00 | Revenue by order (order-level) | Mean is skewed by very large orders; consider median or trimmed mean | Use minimum free-shipping thresholds, bundles, cross-sell |
| 2 | **Average Revenue per User (ARPU)** | Average revenue per customer in a period<br>`ARPU = Total Revenue / Number of Customers` | $120,000 ÷ 1,200 = $100/year ($8.33/month) | Customer-level revenue attribution | Mixes paying and non-paying users if includes inactive accounts | Segment ARPU by channel or cohort to guide acquisition spend |
| 3 | **Average Revenue Per Paying User (ARPPU)** | ARPU calculated only for paying users<br>`ARPPU = Revenue from paying users / Number of paying users` | $120,000 ÷ 600 = $200/year | Flag for paying users, revenue mapping | Changing the paying definition affects comparability | Increase conversion of free → paid or expand add-ons |
| 4 | **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** | Average cost to acquire a customer<br>`CAC = Total S&M Spend / New Customers` | $30,000 ÷ 300 = $100 | Marketing and sales spend attribution, new customer count by channel | Attributing long-term brand spend; including inappropriate costs | Reallocate budget off high CAC/low LTV channels; optimize conversion rates |
| 5 | **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV/LTV)** | Present/expected gross contribution over lifetime<br>`CLV = (AOV × Frequency × Lifetime × Margin)` | $50 × 2 × 3 × 0.6 = $180 | Cohort purchase behavior, margins, churn estimates | Ignoring margins or retention decay; not discounting cashflows | Use CLV to cap CAC and segment acquisition budgets |
| 6 | **LTV:CAC Ratio** | Ratio of customer value vs acquisition cost<br>`LTV:CAC = CLV / CAC` | $180 ÷ $100 = 1.8:1 (Target: 3:1) | Accurate CLV and CAC | Mismatched windows (CLV lifetime vs CAC monthly) | Increase LTV or reduce CAC; modify growth strategy accordingly |
| 7 | **CAC Payback Period** | Months to recoup CAC from gross margins<br>`Payback = CAC / (ARPU per month × gross margin)` | $100 ÷ ($8.33 × 0.6) = 20 months | Monthly ARPU and margin | Ignoring gross margin inflates how quick payback seems | Improve onboarding to raise ARPU, reduce CAC, or increase margin |
| 8 | **Monthly Customer Churn Rate** | Percentage of customers lost per month<br>`Churn = Customers lost / Customers at start` | 50 ÷ 1,000 = 5%/month | Customer lifecycle events; MRR ledger | Mixing active vs paying definitions; not splitting voluntary vs involuntary | Address top reasons (billing, onboarding, product) |

| 10 | **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** | Sum of monthly subscription revenue<br>`ARR = MRR × 12` | MRR = $10,000 → ARR = $120,000 | Subscription billing data, pro-rations handled consistently | Mixing one-time revenue with recurring; not normalizing discounting | Track MRR growth drivers; tie compensation to net new ARR |
| 11 | **Conversion Rate** | Ratio of conversions to visitors<br>`Conversion Rate = Conversions / Visitors` | 2,000 ÷ 50,000 = 4.00% | Visitor counts, conversion events | Incorrect deduplication of visitors; sessions vs users confusion | Run A/B tests for highest-leak stages |

| 14 | **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)** | Revenue generated per ad dollar<br>`ROAS = Revenue from campaign / Ad spend`<br>`True ROAS = Gross profit / Ad spend` | $60,000 ÷ $20,000 = 3.0<br>True ROAS: $36,000 ÷ $20,000 = 1.8 | Campaign attribution, revenue, margin or COGS | Over-crediting channels (attribution), ignoring returns/refunds | Move spend to channels with positive true ROAS |
| 15 | **Return on Investment (ROI)** | Profitability of investment<br>`ROI = (Gain - Cost) / Cost` | ($60,000 - $20,000) ÷ $20,000 = 200% | Accurate measure of gains and invested costs | Using revenue instead of profit as "gain" | Use ROI for prioritization but account for strategic value |
| 16 | **Gross Margin** | Profitability after direct costs<br>`Gross Margin % = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue` | $120,000 × 0.6 = $72,000 gross profit<br>Per-customer: $100 × 0.6 = $60 | COGS per SKU or per service | Overallocating fixed overhead to COGS by mistake | Price or product mix changes to improve margin |
| 17 | **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** | Customer loyalty measure<br>`NPS = %Promoters (9-10) - %Detractors (0-6)` | 60% promoters - 10% detractors = 50 NPS | Survey responses sampled representatively | Small or biased survey sample; mixing transactional and relationship NPS | Track NPS by cohort and remediate recurring detractor themes |
| 18 | **DAU/MAU Stickiness** | Daily engagement ratio<br>`Stickiness = DAU / MAU` | 4,000 ÷ 15,000 = 26.67% | Unique active user counts by period | Counting bots, duplicate user IDs | Improve retention loops; increase daily value |
| 19 | **Activation Rate** | Users achieving value event<br>`Activation = Users achieving value event / Signups` | 1,250 ÷ 5,000 = 25% | Event-level logs for onboarding events | Vague activation definition; mixing events across product modes | Redesign onboarding to shorten TTFV and increase activation |
| 20 | **Magic Number** | SaaS sales efficiency<br>`Magic Number = (Current Q ARR - Prior Q ARR) × 4 / Prior Q S&M expense` | ($30,000 × 4) ÷ $40,000 = 3.0 | Quarterly ARR growth and S&M expense | Lumpy quarter-to-quarter ARR may distort; uses ARR not cash | If >>1, may under-invest in S&M; if <<0.5, inefficient |
| 21 | **Burn Multiple** | Capital efficiency measure<br>`Burn Multiple = Net cash burned / Net new ARR` | $120,000 ÷ $40,000 = 3.0 | Cash flow and revenue growth | Ignoring seasonality, one-time items | Aim for lower burn multiple to be capital efficient |
| 22 | **Take Rate** | Platform revenue percentage<br>`Take Rate = Platform revenue / GMV` | $50,000 ÷ $500,000 = 10% | Transaction records showing gross value and fees | Including refunds or cancellations incorrectly | Optimize take rate and incentives to balance seller/consumer economics |
| 23 | **Inventory Turnover** | Inventory efficiency<br>`Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory`<br>`Days = 365 / Turnover` | $48,000 ÷ $8,000 = 6 turns<br>365 ÷ 6 = 61 days | COGS and inventory levels | Wrongly classifying inventory (consumables, WIP) | Adjust ordering cadence, promotions to reduce days |
| 24 | **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)** | Receivables collection efficiency<br>`DSO = (Receivables / Revenue) × Days in period` | ($20,000 ÷ $120,000) × 365 = 61 days | A/R ledger, recognized revenue | Mixing cash and accrual periods | Tighten credit, incentives for early payment |
